# Weather App

A responsive web-based weather application that allows users to fetch real-time weather data and a 5-day forecast for any city. The app interacts with the OpenWeatherMap API and displays data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and general weather conditions. It also supports unit toggling between Celsius and Fahrenheit, as well as language selection.

## Features

- **Loading Indicator**: Shows a loading spinner while the app fetches data from the API.
